# tictactoe
[js][dom]

Build a game of tic tac toe.

Unless you are very comfortable, build and test the game by running istep by step starting from the beginning.

### Setup
- create an `index.html`.
- create a `script.js` file.

### Create a working game
- create a game that users can play and that fills each square as they select it with either X or O

### Detecting a win state
- modify your game so that the game knows when one player has won or lost
- Use either of the following techniques to detect the win state
  - the easiest win state is to simply check for every hard coded possibility
  - more difficult: counting if there are three of any player's moves in a row / column / diagonal

### Further
- have a start game button that disappears when the game is started
- have the button reappear when the game has ended

### Further
- ask for the names of players 1 and 2 and display that back to them as they play and win

### Further
- let the player choose their symbol

### Even Further - Dynamic Board
- Ask the user in the beginning on the game how large of a board they want.
- Ask them how many in a row they want to qualify as a win
- Detect the win state

### Even Further!!!11!! - Computer Player
- ask the player if they want to play against the computer
- make the computer play by randomly picking a spot on the board
- modify the computer player to be defensive and block the human player from winning
- modify the computer player to be offensive and try to win the game
